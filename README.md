# NeuralNetwork
This is a python implementation of a feed-forward neural network using numpy.
The network is trained by mini-batch graident descent and uses l2 regularization.

## Installation
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agnar22/NeuralNetwork.git
```
navigate into the project folder
```bash
cd NeuralNetwork
```
install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if everything went well you should now be able to run the code
```bash
python3 Main.py
```

## Motivation
I created this project to get insight into the mathematics behind backpropagation in neural networks,
and to learn how to implement it only by using matrix operations.

The neural network is tested by training it on the MNIST images.

## Results
_Coming soon._
